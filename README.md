# Medical_Expense

This was a project for the course Machine Learning SoSe'24 at Saarland University. This project focused on the predictive analysis of a healthcareðŸ’‰ dataset provided by the course coordinators for predicting the healthcare usage of individuals and involves both regression and classification tasks.

The specific target features in this dataset and the respective tasks pertaining to these target features are
as follows.
1. Total Medical Expenditure: This is a continuous feature measuring the total healthcare expenditure
in US dollars. Your goal is to build a regression model that, when deployed, can take the features of
previously unseen patients as input and predict the total medical expenditure.
2. Healthcare Utilization: This is a binary categorical feature that can either indicate LOW usage or
HIGH usage. Your goal is to build a binary classification model that, when deployed, can take the features
of previously unseen patients as input and predict the utilization category of the healthcare system.
